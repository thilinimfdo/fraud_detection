# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

The objective of the project is to predict whether a given financial transaction is fraud or not.

Fraudulent transactions are costing the financial industry a huge overhead and it is rising [[1]](#1). Given the nature of our course work and my desire to find employment in the finance industry, I believe working on a similar project will be immensely helpful.

## Data Source

I am planning on using the PaySim dataset from Kaggle.com [[2]](#2). The dataset is generated based on financial transactions collected over a month in Africa. It records individual transactions with different types. Given there are multiple sources, I selected this data source given that each transaction is labelled whether it is fraud or not. 

The data set contains 6M+ transactions and with 11 different columns. The following images from R shows the structure of the dataset.
